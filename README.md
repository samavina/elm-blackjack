# elm-blackjack
This is a single-player implementation of the game Blackjack written in Elm. You can begin a new game by pressing the "New Game" button.
As you play, your wins, losses, ties, and win rate will be tracked and displayed on screen. Each hand must be played out before a new game
can be started. At the end of each hand, "New Game" must be pressed to start the next hand. "Reset" can be pressed at any time to reset all
the statistics displayed on the screen and set the game back the the initial state. Have fun!

To run the game, you need to have Elm installed. From within the directory, type "elm reactor", go to http://localhost:8000,
and click on "Blackjack.elm" to start playing.

This project was created for CMSC 22300 Functional Programming in Spring 2020.
